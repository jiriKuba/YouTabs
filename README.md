# YouTabs
Google chrome extension for searching guitar tabs.

This extension is basically popup window with search box.
But when you are on youtube page search box text will be replaced by name of video.
I'm using http://www.911tabs.com as search engine.
Extension is free.

You can download extension here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/youtabs/fkkjjojgnfcnfdaiokeoffaakaaaimoa
